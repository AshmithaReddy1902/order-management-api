Order Management API (Spring Boot)
 Overview

The Order Management API is a monolithic backend application built using Spring Boot that supports end-to-end order processing for an e-commerce–style system.
It manages products, inventory, and orders, ensuring transactional consistency between order placement and inventory reservation.

This project demonstrates real-world backend concepts such as layered architecture, database transactions, global exception handling, and RESTful API design.

Architecture

This application follows a clean layered monolithic architecture:

Controller → Service → Repository → Database

 Tech Stack

Java 25

Spring Boot

Spring Web (REST APIs)

Spring Data JPA

Hibernate

SQL Server (SSMS)

Maven

Postman (API testing)

 Features

Create and manage products

Track inventory per product

Place orders with inventory reservation

Cancel orders and release reserved inventory

Transactional integrity using @Transactional

Global exception handling with meaningful API responses

RESTful API design with proper HTTP status codes

Database Design

Main tables:

products

inventory

orders

order_items

Key behaviors:

Inventory is reserved when an order is placed

Inventory is released when an order is cancelled

Orders and inventory updates occur within a single transaction

 API Endpoints
➤ Product APIs
Method	Endpoint	Description
POST	/api/products	Create a product
GET	/api/products/{id}	Get product by ID
➤ Order APIs
Method	Endpoint	Description
POST	/api/orders	Place a new order
GET	/api/orders/{id}	Get order by ID
POST	/api/orders/{id}/cancel	Cancel an order
Sample Requests
Create Product
{
  "sku": "SKU-1001",
  "name": "Wireless Mouse",
  "price": 19.99,
  "initialStock": 50
}

Place Order
{
  "items": [
    {
      "productId": 1,
      "quantity": 2
    }
  ]
}

Cancel Order
POST /api/orders/1/cancel
 Error Handling

The application uses global exception handling (@RestControllerAdvice) to return consistent JSON error responses.

Example:

{
  "status": 400,
  "message": "Insufficient inventory for product 1",
  "timestamp": "2026-01-12T20:37:28"
}


This prevents leaking stack traces and improves API usability.
